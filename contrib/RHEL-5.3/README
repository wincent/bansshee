This directory contains platform-specific Bansshee support files for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.3.

  - configuration file:
    - etc/bansshee.conf
  - logwatch filter files:
    - etc/logwatch/conf/services/bansshee.conf
    - etc/logwatch/conf/services/secure.conf
    - etc/logwatch/scripts/services/bansshee
  - startup script:
    - etc/rc.d/init.d/bansshee


DIFFERENCES FROM THE DEFAULT SETTINGS

The default settings in the bansshee script were designed to work with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux ES 3. There are three main differences when moving to RHEL
5.3:

  (1) Some of the status messages emitted by sshd have changed slightly:
      - what was previously "illegal user" is now "invalid user"
      - instead of just "Failed password", we might also see now "Failed none"
        and "Failed publickey"
  (2) The logwatch configuration files have moved from "/etc/log.d" to
      "/etc/logwatch". In addition, a minor bug in the previous version of the
      logwatch script has been corrected (previously it tried to match
      "appended" when it should have matched "added").
  (3) Appending the BANSSHEE chain to the default firewall rules will have no
      effect because by the time the initial INPUT chain is finished all SSH
      traffic will already have been accepted; we therefore have to insert the
      chain rather than appended. (Obviously if you have a custom set of
      firewall rules then you may want to tweak this even further, inserting
      the BANSSHEE chain before a specific rule number.)


INSTALLATION

To use the configuration file, copy it into the /etc directory:

  sudo cp etc/bansshee.conf /etc/bansshee.conf

To use the filter files, copy them to the appropriate directories:

  sudo cp etc/logwatch/conf/services/* \
          /etc/logwatch/conf/services/
  sudo cp etc/logwatch/scripts/services/bansshee \
          /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/

To use the startup script, copy it to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:

  sudo cp etc/rc.d/init.d/bansshee /etc/rc.d/init.d/

Specify that the basshee service should be started at boot time:

  sudo chkconfig bansshee on

Confirm that the service will be started at boot:

  sudo chkconfig --list bansshee

Start the bansshee service if not already started:

  sudo service bansshee start
