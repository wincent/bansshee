This directory contains platform-specific Bansshee support files for Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3.


LOGWATCH FILTER FILES

  etc/log.d/conf/services/bansshee.conf
  etc/log.d/scripts/services/bansshee


STARTUP SCRIPT

  etc/rc.d/init.d/bansshee


INSTALLATION

To use the filter files, copy them to the appropriate directories:

  sudo /bin/cp etc/log.d/conf/services/bansshee.conf /etc/log.d/conf/services/
  sudo /bin/cp etc/log.d/scripts/services/bansshee /etc/log.d/scripts/services/

Depending on your configuration you may need to make changes to your existing LogWatch configuration to cleanly integrate 
the new filters. For example, on the stock Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 install (Taroon Update 7) it is necessary 
to edit the following file:

  /etc/log.d/conf/services/secure.conf

By adding "bansshee" to the $ignore_services line as shown below:

  # Use this to ignore certain services in the secure log.
  # You can ignore as many services as you would like.
  # (we ignore sshd because its entries are processed by the sshd script)
  $ignore_services = sshd Pluto stunnel proftpd bansshee

To use the startup script, copy it to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:

  sudo /bin/cp etc/rc.d/init.d/bansshee /etc/rc.d/init.d/

Specify that the basshee service should be started at boot time:

  sudo /sbin/chkconfig bansshee on

Confirm that the service will be started at boot:

  sudo /sbin/chkconfig --list bansshee

Start the bansshee service if not already started:

  sudo /sbin/service bansshee start
