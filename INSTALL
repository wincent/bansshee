The recommended install location for Bansshee is:

  /usr/local/sbin/bansshee

As a convenience Bansshee comes with a Makefile that can be used to perform this installation by typing:

  sudo make install

To install manually you would use a pair of commands like:

  sudo cp -f bansshee /usr/local/sbin/
  sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/bansshee

See the README file for details on configuring, starting and stopping Bansshee.

See the support directory for platform-specific files such as init scripts (for automatic launch at boot time) and LogWatch 
filters.
