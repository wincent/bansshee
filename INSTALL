The recommended install location for Bansshee is:

  /usr/local/sbin/bansshee

As a convenience Bansshee comes with a Makefile that can be used to perform this installation by changing to the Bansshee directory and typing the following:

  sudo make install

The Makefile requires that you have the "install" command present on your system.

To install manually you would use a pair of commands like:

  install -d /usr/local/sbin
  install -m 755 bansshee /usr/local/sbin

See the README file for details on configuring, starting and stopping Bansshee.

See the support directory for platform-specific files such as init scripts (for automatic launch at boot time) and LogWatch 
filters.
