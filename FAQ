BANSSHEE FAQ

If I connect as an invalid user sshd writes the corresponding message to the logfile. Approximately 5 to 60 seconds later 
Bansshee writes its message. Is this delay normal/intended?

Yes, the delay is normal. It occurs because Bansshee uses the File::Tail CPAN module. From the File::Tail documentation:

'The module tries very hard NOT to "busy-wait" on a file that has little traffic. Any time it reads new data from the file, 
it counts the number of new lines, and divides that number by the time that passed since data were last written to the file 
before that. That is considered the average time before new data will be written. When there is no new data to read, 
File::Tail sleeps for that number of seconds. Thereafter, the waiting time is recomputed dynamicaly. Note that File::Tail 
never sleeps for more than the number of seconds set by maxinterval.'
